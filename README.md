## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

    Node.js >= v12.22.9

### Installing

1. Clone or download the repository

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/fernunex/game-mokepon.git
    ```

2. Open the project directory and then install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    $ npm install
    ```

3. Run the app (server):

    ```bash
    $ node index.js 
    ```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Go to http://127.0.0.1:8070/ or http://localhost:8070/ when the game is running. Then open a new tab at the same URL (http://127.0.0.1:8070/) to simulate two players on a different computer, then you can select the mokepon, and then when you are in the map you can collide with another mokepon and the fight is gonna start, finally, you select the order of your attacks and wait for the enemy's attacks.

If you want to play on any device in your local network, then you can modify the 'urlLocalHost' variable located at line 86 file /public/js/index.js for the IP address of your server.
And configure your firewall to allow HTTP connection through port 8070, though.
